	<p>
	My Seaglass Creations are made with copper wire and glass that has been smoothed byMother Nature or helped along by me.The frame is solid copper wire which I fill in like a puzzle with hand wrapped glass in a lighter gauge copper wire.Actual Seaglass hard to find so I help along recycled glass with a rock tumbler.Most pieces are equal parts tumbled and ocean glass,.They are durable for either inside your house or outside.Anything you see can be made in any size or if you don't see what you'd like I can make almost anything you can think of.
	
	They can be either hangings or 3-d creations that free standing or perched on driftwood.Although I make similar pieces, all of my creations are originals. The piece you receive wont be identical to the pictures you see due to the shapes n sizes of the glass i use.Since i make all pieces to order, please allow 3 to 4 weeks for delivery.
